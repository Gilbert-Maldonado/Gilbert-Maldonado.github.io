**What did I do this week?**

Downing gave background information regarding the project that was assigned called Allocator. He gave us inspiration to the problem in that some embedded systems do not have a heap; they only have a stack. So for this project we are creating an allocator that could work on the stack. He made an analogy in class about the differences between having a garbage collector and not having one. It's similar to americans wanting an automatic car rather than a manual car. The safety is better and the people driving automatic cars don't have to do anything when accelerating. Although, people who drive the automatic car have more control over the car and the car is cheaper to buy. The garbage collector is the automatic car.

Downing talked about common errors that can occur when working with allocating and deallocating. Such as deallocating the same spot twice or deallocating a spot with a different address.

Downing briefly started the implementation for the vector class and we're going through how it's made under the covers.

The implementation of the project that was assigned is very straight-forward. I had a couple of questions regarding the deallocate method but then I remembered to just follow how C++ handles it. This made everything really easy.

**What's in your way?**

The project is due next week so we'll be working on that to complete it. 

**What will you do next week?**

The third project is due and HackTX is next week!
