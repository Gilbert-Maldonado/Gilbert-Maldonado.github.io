**What did I do this week?**


**What's in your way?**

I have a Number Theory test next week. So that'll be in the way a little bit.

**What will you do next week?**

The next project is coming out so I plan to start out on that early. I project is called game of life I think and I'm sure it'll be more extensive than this past project.

**Quick Tip**

From a podcast called _Coding Blocks_ three people talk about JavaScript Promises and provide insight on how Promises differ from callback functions. It's a great listen. I don't think they start talking about Promises until around the thirty minute mark.
