**What did I do this week?**

He talked about the dfferent casts that you can do and said that you can only do a dynamic_cast if you have at least one virtual method. He then gave an argument on why you should almost never modify the signatures in the base class. First, because it can break user's code if your code is an API. Second, it could break your own code because of overriding issues and it may take you a while to figure where the problem is occurring.

Spiceworks came to give a talk about what it is like to be a software developer. They talked about what technologies they use and gave some tips on what should be on a resume.

Downing then gave us motivations for using an abstract class. Downing talked about when virtual methods can be inlined.

**What's in your way?**

There is nothing in my way at the moment.


**What will you do next week?**

Thanksgiving week is this coming week so I'll be going to my parent's home to visit.
