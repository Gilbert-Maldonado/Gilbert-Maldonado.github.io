**What did I do this week?**
A recent UT graduate that is now an employee at Bloomberg came to talk to the class about what he works on from a day to day basis. He talked about the different technologies that Bloomberg uses and why learning is something you should never stop doing. He said that the teams at Bloomberg use any language or software that is the best for the job. I also started working on a simple chrome extension. I might be able to finish it in a week or two depending on how much time I have free. After I finish it I might make a quick guide on how to create a chrome extension in regards to how I made mine. I also worked on the project.

**What's in your way?**
I've been getting ready for the career fair and that has taken up a little bit of
my time.

**What will you do next week?**
I will be busy with the career fair and finishing up the project. I'm going to definitely remember that the project is due at 10pm and not midnight on Thursday.

**Quick Tip** 
An easier way to search for things is to use `ctrl+shift+f` (different command in other OS) in sublime after you have indicated a specific folder for which to search through. You specify this location under the 'Where' field that is displayed after pressing the shortcut. I personally like it better than grep because it's easier to look at and if you click on any of the results it will take you to the location of where that result came from.
