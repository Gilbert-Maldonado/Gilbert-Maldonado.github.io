**What did I do this week?**

This past week Downing talked about how AbstractCell works in terms of ConwayCell and FredkinCell. He talked about what refinement overriding was and how it applies to the classes he was talking about. He then ran through an example of how abstract classes are implemented in the example of shapes. The Shape class was the abstract class while classes such as Circle would be the concrete class. Downing then talked about how methods are called and the order in which they are called.He talked about the keyword _virtual_ and what it does to the methods.

**What's in your way?**

There is nothing in my way this week. My week is pretty chill.


**What will you do next week?**

I will continue to be working on the last project. The project has been somewhat straightforward so far and overall it's a great project.


**Quick Tip**

If you type _history_ on the terminal you will get a list of the previous commands you have entered. I'm not sure how long the buffer is but it seems pretty long (my list has 512 elements).


Bonus tip: If you want to write a code snippit on Facebook messenger all you have to do is put _```_ before and after your code snippet and it will look better than just typing the code.

Bonus Bonus tip: If you want to highlight text fast then just hold shift and use the _home_ or _end_ key to highlight a line. You can also use the arrow keys after holding shift to highlight multiple lines. Then once you have those lines highlighted you can move those lines up or down as a group with the arrow keys if you hold down CTRL as well as shift.
