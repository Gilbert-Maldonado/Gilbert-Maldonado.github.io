title: Week Two

**What did I do this week?**
Downing discussed more optimizations that can be done on our project and also talked about the first project some more. He also went over how exceptions are handled in C++ and gave a practical example of how it would be handled in ATMs.

**What's in your way?**
The biggest thing that was in my way was setting up the environment for the first project. It took a very long time because the instructions weren’t very specific. It was difficult for me in particular because I am working on a windows machine. It’ll be a lot easier to set up in the future because now Docker will work when I start the next project.

**What will you do next week?**
I plan to continue reading the book while trying to stay ahead of the game. The project is also due next week so I’ll be doing that in the coming days to try to get it out of the way.


He talked about giving ranks to the top half of the class but hasn’t given a specific reason as to why. I think the purpose of it is to try to push us to perform better. Personally, I don’t care at all about the rank and it has no significance to me. It’s a waste of time to be concerned about it.

**Quick Tip**
If you go to the GDC lab machines and type 'LS' in the terminal then a train will go across the screen. I think there is another way to make the train go across but I don't remember what the command was.
