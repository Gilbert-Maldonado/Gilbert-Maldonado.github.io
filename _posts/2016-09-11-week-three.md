title: Week Three

**What did I do this week?**
I was working on the first project about the Collatz Conjecture. We learned more about references and pointers in class.

**What's in your way?**
Line-endings was in my way this past week. I just had to make sure I was using unix (LF) line-endings as opposed to windows (CRLF).

**What will you do next week?**
I will continue to read, and I’ll be starting the next project since it should be coming out during the weekend. Career fair is the week after so I’ll be doing interview prep as well.


**Thoughts**
The first project was somewhat a disaster. A lot of information that was helpful to complete the project was on Piazza. If you weren’t careful you might have read a post that was outdated so the information was wrong. It would be helpful if the author of each post would update the post to the correct information.

Another thing that bugged me was how Travis CI was down for about a day. As mentioned by other students, if this was industry and something similar to Travis CI went down then this would be high priority. Instead, the instructors didn’t comment on the issue until the issue was resolved, which you would never see happen in industry.

Even though the first project was a rough start, I am encouraged by Downing’s openness to student input and I am confident that the first project will be improved next year.


**Quick Tip**
Use `grep` and `sed` if you want to search and replace every instance of a string across multiple files. The following link is helpful if you’re interested.
