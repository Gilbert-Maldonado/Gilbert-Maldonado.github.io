**What did I do this week?**
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to go to the first class day because I was still on the waitlist for the class. For the second class day we talked about unit tests and assertions. For example, he showed the class gcov which is a way to see how much of your tests have covered your program that you wrote. Then he went on to talk about the Collatz conjecture and used the algorithm to further explain how testing should be done.

**What's in your way?**
I'm still waiting for my book to come in for the class because I ordered it online. The book for this course is "An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (3rd Edition)" by Timonth Budd.

**What will you do next week?**
I plan to get started on the project early and try to have it finished before the end of the week.


Overall, the class is informative and the instructor is very articulate in his examples. He doesn't just tell you not to do something but gives you the _why_. I really like how the projects have the rule of not working with the same person twice because it forces you to work with new people that you have never worked with before.

**Quick Tip**
Personally, I like to use the IDE, Intellij. If you have your GitHub linked to Intellij then a nice feature that is available is creating a gist for any code that you want. Whether it be a file or a code snippet all it takes is a right-click or your operating system equivalent.
