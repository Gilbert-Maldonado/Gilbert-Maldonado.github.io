**What did I do this week?**
A UT graduate that is now an employee at JPL came to talk to the class about what he works on from a day to day basis. He talked about the design process that they go through when trying to come up with new ideas. One method they use is that they all create ideas on sticky notes and take turns putting the sticky notes onto the wall. Then while they're doing this they group together the ideas. This process helps people voice their ideas because it wouldn't cause one person to press their ideas by simply talking louder than the others. He then showed us Mars through the Microsoft HoloLens and showed us the web application for it as well. Multiple researchers can also connect to it and be able to talk to each other through it.

**What's in your way?**
Classes with midterms coming up is what was in my way this past week. The career fair was in the way and it took a lot of time because 

**What will you do next week?**
There's no assignment that is out so I'm just going to continue to go to class and learn C++. I will also study for the midterm in this class that is coming up. 

**Quick Tip**
On Windows, press WIN + l to lock the computer. I think the command in linux is CTRL + ALT + l. I’m not sure about mac. If you press the power button on laptops it puts your computer to sleep(don’t hold it down to long or the computer might shut off).
